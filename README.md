# Time Master: The Enforcer Node

**Maintain the Laboratory.** Time Master is a high-performance productivity enforcer designed for engineers and deep-work architects. It replaces passive tracking with a technical audit of every hour.

## ⚡ Core Protocols

### 1. Deep Work Focus (Scientific Betting)
Every session begins with a **Pre-Commitment**. You must define your goal before the timer starts.
*   **The Audit:** At the end of the session, the app aggressively grabs focus, forcing a **Session Review**.
*   **Data Dossier:** Records what you worked on, what you completed, focus scores, value metrics, and obstacles.
*   **Momentum Node:** Every review forces you to define the "Very Next Task" and a "Quick Win" for later.

### 2. Simple Timer (Infinite Pomodoro)
For classic focus cycles, toggle **Simple Timer** mode:
*   **Automatic Cycling:** Seamlessly transitions between **Focus Period** and **Rest Period**.
*   **Zero-Friction:** The timer auto-starts the next phase, keeping you in the flow without manual interaction.
*   **Session Tally:** A persistent counter tracks your completed runs in the current mode.

### 3. The Enforcer (Environmental Control)
*   **Auto-Hide:** When the timer starts, the app dives into the taskbar immediately to clear your visual field.
*   **Aggressive Focus:** On timer end, the app forces itself to the front of all windows, locking the interface until the session is reviewed or discarded.
*   **Audio Feedback:** High-frequency "peeps" provide physical confirmation for every start, pause, and state transition.

## 🎨 Creative Architects

### Theme Designer
Customize your environment with **12 Calibrated Themes** (including Nordic Light, Noir, and Void) or build your own:
*   **Surface Control:** Granular transparency for cards and inputs.
*   **Typographic Decoupling:** Separate color paths for System text vs. Data text.
*   **Neutralized Interface:** All modals and settings perfectly synchronize with your active theme.

### Sound Designer
Design your own focus reminders:
*   **Pitch Calibration:** Adjust frequencies (Hz) for notification tones.
*   **Synthesizer Styles:** Choose between Sine, Square, Triangle, and Sawtooth waveforms.
*   **Stochastic Mode:** Enable random frequency generation to prevent audio habituation.

## 📂 Data & Storage Node

### Dossier-Style History
Your work is no longer a simple list—it's a professional ledger:
*   **Tiered Hierarchy:** Grouped information (Context ↔ Analysis ↔ Momentum).
*   **Quick-Scannability:** Mini-badges in the collapsed view show Focus/Value scores and Goal status at a glance.
*   **Full CRUD:** Edit past recordings to refine insights or delete anomalies.

### Storage Portability
*   **Custom JSON Node:** Specify exactly where your data is saved.
*   **Auto-Load:** Switch between different log files for different projects; the app auto-loads existing data on selection.
*   **Direct Access:** Open your data folder instantly from the settings menu.

## 🛠 Installation & Build

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev environment (Vite + Electron)
npm start
```

### Production Build (Windows)
To compile into a native standalone executable with the custom high-fidelity icon:
```bash
npm run compile
```
The distributable `.exe` will be located in the `release/` directory.

## 📜 Philosophy: "Intentional Minimalism"
Time Master is built on the belief that **friction is information**. By forcing an audit of every hour, the app transforms "busy-work" into a sequence of verified technical victories.
