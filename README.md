# 🧪 Time Master: The Enforcer Node

**Time Master** is a high-stakes productivity enforcer designed for engineers and architects who practice deep work. It replaces passive time-tracking with **Scientific Betting**—a methodology that forces you to predict outcomes and audit friction in real-time.

## ⚡ Core Protocol

### 1. The Pre-Commitment (The Bet)
Before any focus session begins, you must **Place Your Bet**. 
> *"I bet I can [Result] in the next [Time] if I [Action] because [Reason]."*
This turns every hour into a controlled experiment, sharpening your predictive accuracy over time.

### 2. The Enforcer (Aggressive Focus)
Once the timer starts, the app enters **Enforcer Mode**:
*   **Auto-Minimize:** Dives into the taskbar immediately to clear your visual field.
*   **Window Grab:** When time is up, the app aggressively forces itself to the front of all workspaces, locking your interface until you reflect.
*   **Idle Pinging:** If you linger on the dashboard without starting a session, the node plays rotating synthesized "peeps" to break focus-friction.

### 3. Reflection Node
At the end of every session, you must audit the experiment:
*   **Scientific Result:** Was the bet won or lost?
*   **Friction Analysis:** Identify the exact resistance point.
*   **Protocol Decision:** Choose to **Continue** (same bet, instant restart) or **Pivot** (redefine strategy).

## 🎨 Visual Interface (Theme Architect)

Time Master includes **12 Calibrated Themes** and a built-in **Theme Architect** for total environmental control:

*   **Enforcer:** Digital Brutalism (Deep Violet/Black).
*   **Noir:** Zero-distraction pitch black.
*   **Nordic Light:** Soft, clinical grey for bright workspaces.
*   **Void:** Absolute high-contrast monochrome.
*   **Theme Architect:** Granular control over Backgrounds, Card Alpha, Input surfaces, and Data vs. System typography.

---

## 📂 Archive Node

All sessions are stored in a local, persistent JSON database (`%AppData%/time-master/time_master_logs.json`).
*   **Daily Filtering:** Scan logs by temporal node (date).
*   **Full CRUD:** Edit past entries to refine insights or delete anomalies.
*   **JSON Export:** Instant "Copy to Clipboard" for AI analysis or external documentation.

## 🛠 Installation & Build

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev environment (Vite + Electron)
npm start
```

### Production Build (Windows)
To compile into a native standalone executable:
```bash
npm run compile
```
The distributable `.exe` will be located in the `release/` directory.

## ⚙️ System Requirements
*   **OS:** Windows 10/11 (Optimized for frameless window management).
*   **Runtime:** Node.js 18+.

## 📜 Philosophy: "Intentional Minimalism"
Time Master is built on the belief that **friction is information**. By forcing a scientific audit of every hour, the app transforms "busy-work" into a sequence of verified technical victories.
